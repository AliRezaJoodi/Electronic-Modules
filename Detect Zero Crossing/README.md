It's a schematic for **Detect Zero Crossing**. I tested it for many times and worked great. It has included:
- Pictures (It has included photos of samples I made.)
- Schematic (It has included schematic file and will open with Altium Designer software.)
- Simulate (It has included simulator file and will open with Proteus software.)
