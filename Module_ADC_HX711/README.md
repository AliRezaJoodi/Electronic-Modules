It's about **ADC Module with HX711**. 
The HX711 is a precision 24-bit ADC that is designed for weighing scales and industrial control applications to interface directly with a bridge sensor. 
I tested it and worked great.  

It has included:
- Hardware Design (Included hardware layers.)
- Pictures (Included photos samples made.)
