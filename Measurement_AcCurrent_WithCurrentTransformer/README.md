## AC Current Measurement Using Current Transformer for Differential Analog Input

Note: These voltage input pairs have a maximum differential signal of ±0.5V. In addition, the maximum signal level on analog inputs is ±0.5V with respect to AGND.

Note: It's usable for ADE7858 IC. ADE7858 is a energy metering IC.
